    <!--Make style tag to implement css in html file-->
    <!--classes are defined within p tag and named, you can adjust the specific class in css code using .className {css code}-->
    <!--class is a name for a specific type or style of text, can be called whenever you want those attributes (size, color ect.. added to the paragraph or other tags)-->
    <!--span is used to place a class within a chosen segment or line of code , for example can span a class mid paragraph and change whats in it to be green, define a selected segment of text and applies a class to it-->
    <style type="text/css">
      p {
        /*in css this is how you do comments*/
        /*all font in all p tags will be 200%*/
        font-size: 200%;
      }
      .para1 {
        font-size: 200%;
        color: blue;
      }
      /*ID uses # not .*/
      #once {
        font-size: 120%;
        color: green;
      }

  <body>
    <p class="para1">This is a paragraph given a class name of p1</p>
    <p id="once">
      This paragraph is defined with an ID type not a class type, the only
      difference is that id's
      <span class="para1"
        >This is a span with para1 class called, text is 200% regular size and
        be blue</span
      >should only be used for one thing, classes can be shared (5 paragraphs
      can be using same class name, cannot use id that way).
    </p>
    <p>This paragraph tag will be larger than usual</p>
